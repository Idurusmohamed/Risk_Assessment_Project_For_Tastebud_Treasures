This project outlines a cybersecurity risk assessment and proposes mitigation strategies for a fictional small e-commerce business, "Tastebud Treasures," which operates as a monthly subscription service delivering curated boxes of artisanal food products.

Phase 1: Business Understanding and Asset Identification
1.1. Business Description:

"Tastebud Treasures" is an online e-commerce business based in the United States that offers monthly subscription boxes filled with a variety of gourmet and artisanal food items sourced from small producers. The business model involves:

Customer Acquisition: Primarily through online marketing, social media, and word-of-mouth.
Subscription Management: Customers sign up for monthly subscriptions through the website, providing personal and payment information.
Product Curation: The owner/manager selects and sources the food items for each month's box.
Order Processing: Once a subscription payment is processed, the system generates a fulfillment request.
Shipping: Boxes are assembled and shipped to subscribers' addresses.
Customer Support: Primarily handled via email and a contact form on the website.
Data Handling: Collection and storage of customer PII (name, address, email, payment details), subscription preferences, and order history.

State-Specific Privacy Laws (e.g., CCPA in California): Depending on the location of their customers and the amount of personal information processed.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): If they have customers in the European Union.
