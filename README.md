## Summary of Risk Assessment Findings

The risk assessment identified several potential threats and vulnerabilities to Tastebud Treasures' information assets and business operations. These risks range from low to critical, with the following being the most significant:

* **Critical Risks:** Unpatched web servers and PCI DSS non-compliance pose the greatest threats, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruptions, financial losses, and legal repercussions.
* **High Risks:** Phishing attacks, weak passwords, SQL injection vulnerabilities, lack of security awareness training, inadequate incident response planning, and GDPR non-compliance also present significant risks.
* **Medium Risks**: DDoS Attacks, Insider Threats, Natural Disasters, Unauthorized Access, Vendor Security Practices and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities.

The report recommends a range of technical and administrative controls to mitigate these risks, including:

* Implementing a robust patch management system
* Enforcing strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
* Deploying a web application firewall
* Encrypting sensitive data
* Providing regular security awareness training
* Developing and implementing a comprehensive incident response plan
